## Reflection

### How do I approach designing software?  
When approaching software design, I start by breaking down complex ideas into smaller, manageable pieces that can be represented efficiently. In this project, I applied that mindset by analyzing my reference image and building the castle scene from primitive shapes. For example, the towers were constructed from cylinders with cone roofs and a battlement ring, while the garden topiary combined spheres and a cylinder trunk. Additional details such as lamps were built from cylinders and spheres, and the ground was represented by a simple plane. This modular approach helped me practice skills such as low-poly optimization, UV-mapped texturing, and keeping geometry under 1,000 triangles for performance. By focusing on modularity and reusability, I designed objects that were efficient to render and easy to refine. These tactics are transferable to future projects, since they emphasize planning, structure, and scalable design.

### How do I approach developing programs?  
During development, I used strategies like modular functions (RenderTower(), RenderFrontGarden(), and RenderLamps()) to handle repeated tasks and keep my code organized. Each milestone required iteration, first ensuring shapes displayed correctly, then layering in textures like brick, stone pavers, wood, and foliage, followed by Phong lighting that combined a directional light for sunlight with a tinted point light to simulate lantern glow. Iteration allowed me to refine transformations, debug navigation (WASD + Q/E movement, mouse look, and scroll speed), and add camera projection toggling. Over the course, my style evolved from simply making objects appear to building them with efficiency, modularity, and interactivity in mind. This incremental, test-driven approach is one I can apply to any software project.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?  
This project showed me how computational graphics and visualization strengthen my ability to present ideas clearly and interactively. Learning to combine textures, lighting, and navigation created a 3D world that feels polished and functional, which has applications beyond just graphics. Academically, these skills support my progression through computer science by improving how I design and structure complex projects. Professionally, they give me tools to present technical findings in visual, interactive ways. As I pursue a career in cybersecurity, being able to create visualizations, whether for network activity, threat modeling, or attack simulations, will help me communicate complex information effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Graphics taught me the value of clarity, modularity, and iteration, all of which apply directly to my long-term goals.
